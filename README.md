# ddnet-custom-clients
Custom clients IDs for DDNet so custom clients can identify which client is each player using by checking invalid country flags

First implemented in Kaizo Network, but it can also be shared among other clients

Clients using this:

* [Kaizo Client](https://github.com/M0REKZ/kaizo-client)
* [Chillerbot-UX](https://chillerbot.github.io/)
* [Duck Client](https://pointer31.github.io/duckclient)

# Adding a new client

When adding a new client ID, make sure the ID number is greater than the ID for Kaizo Network, this way we avoid conflicts with possible future DDNet country flag additions.

# How to use
